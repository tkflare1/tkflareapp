# Prework – tkflareapp

Submitted by: **Keith Tawe Vhurumuku**

This is a super‑simple iOS app that demonstrates the basics of Interface Builder and Swift actions.  
When the user taps the button, the app picks a random background color for the entire screen and updates a status label with the new hex value.

Time spent: **2.5 hours** total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] User sees a screen containing **three labels** and **one button**
- [x] Tapping the button changes the **background color** of the screen to a random color

## App Brainstorming

### Favorite apps & killer features

| App | Feature #1 | Feature #2 |
|-----|------------|------------|
| Instagram | Seamless stories swipe‑through | Powerful in‑app photo editor |
| Duolingo | Bite‑sized daily goals | Streak + XP gamification |
| Notion | Drag‑to‑reorder blocks | Real‑time collaboration |
| Spotify | Discover Weekly playlist | Lyrics synced to playback |

### My app idea – *FlashFuel*

**FlashFuel** is a mobile study companion that mixes spaced‑repetition flashcards with quick “brain‑fuel” breaks (30‑second wellness tips or breathing exercises).  
Key features I’d like to prototype:

1. **Adaptive deck scheduler** – cards reappear based on individual accuracy and response time.  
2. **Micro‑break overlay** – after every 10 cards, the app suggests a guided stretch or hydration reminder.  
3. **Camera‑scan card creation** – point the phone at textbook diagrams; OCR+Vision auto‑generates a flashcard pair (front = image, back = user annotation).  

I’m interested in blending productivity with healthy study habits, and this project would let me practice Core Data, VisionKit, and local notifications in iOS.

## Notes

* Biggest challenge: wiring the `IBAction`—Xcode initially dropped it **outside** the class, causing a build error. Re‑dragging the connection inside the class scope fixed it.
